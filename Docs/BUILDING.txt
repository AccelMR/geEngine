  GE_ENGINE_PROFILER - Must define to use the profilers
  GE_UTILITIES_EXPORT - This must be defined if the geUtilities lib wants to be used as a DLL
  GE_CORE_EXPORT - This must be defined if the geCore lib wants to be used as a DLL
  GE_IS_ENGINEEDITOR - The game editor shoulb be built with this define

Enviromental variables
  %DEVLIBS% - Root folder where the external libraries are located

  GoogleTest - For Unit Test design
  LZ4 - For data compression
  TetGen - For Delaunay tetrahedralization and Voronoi diagrams
